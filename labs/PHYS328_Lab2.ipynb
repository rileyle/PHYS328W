    "2. Choose a resistor on the order of 1 k$\\Omega$ and a capacitor on the order of 0.01 $\\mu$F, and measure their values using the DMM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Construct either one of the circuits in Figure 1 on the breadboard using the function generator with a sinusoidal wave form and an amplitude of 1 V as your voltage source.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Set up the oscilloscope to display $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ together, and use the oscilloscope and function generator to explore the frequency dependence of the voltage gain $|V_{out}|/|V_{in}|$, where $|V_{out}|$ and $|V_{in}|$ are the amplitudes of the signals. \n",

    "  \n",
    "6. Once you have a sense of the behavior of the circuit, measure the amplitudes $|V_{in}|$ and $|V_{out}|$ and the phase angle (really, you'll be measuring $\\Delta t$) at at least 10 frequencies that span the range over which the gain and phase angle are changing significantly and that cover the range of $V_{out}/V_{in}$ values well. The phase angle $\\phi$ is related to the time difference $\\Delta t = t_{V_{out}}-t_{V_{in}}$ between $V_{out}$ and $V_{in}$ via Equation 27 in the notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "    *Pay attention to the sign of $\\Delta t$. As we have defined it, if $t_{V_{out}} > t_{V_{in}}$, $\\Delta t$ and $\\phi$ are positive.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    *To set up automated amplitude measurements, see \"Reference\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Measure\" in the User Manual for your oscilloscope, and for help measuring $\\Delta t$ with the cursors, see \"Application examples\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Taking Cursor Measurements.\"*\n",
