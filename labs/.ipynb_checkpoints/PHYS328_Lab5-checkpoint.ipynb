    "3. Measure the resistances of the 100 $\\Omega$ and 1 k$\\Omega$ resistors with a DMM.\n",
    "4. Construct the circuit shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "5. Use the DMM to confirm which direction to turn the pot to increase/decrease the resistance. This depends on how the pot is oriented on the prototyping board relative to the rest of the circuit.\n",
    "6. Turn the pot all the way down so that the transistor will start in the “off” state, and turn on the power to your prototyping board.\n",
    "7. Turn on the prototyping board, and set the positive variable supply voltage to 15 V.\n",
    "8. While monitoring the voltage drop across the 100 $\\Omega$ collector resistor, slowly turn up the pot, collecting several sets of $I_C$, $I_E$, and $V_{BE}$ measurements in the range over which $I_C$ and $I_E$ vary.\n",
    "   - Use Ohm’s law to determine $I_C$ and $I_E$ from the measured voltage drops across the collector and emitter resistors and their measured resistances.\n",
    "   - Note that $V_{BE}$ is not the potential difference between the base and ground. The DMM probe placement is illustrated in Figure 1.\n",
    "   - Map the “off” and active states of the transistor. If the emitter potential is held above that of the base, the transistor will no longer be able to operate as advertised. You should see this happen very close to the top of the range of the pot."
