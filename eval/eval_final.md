Periodic evaluations keep us focused on the goals of the course, help us identify and address challenges and other issues so that this can be a successful learning experience, and serve as an ongoing conversation that will eventually result in your final grade. *This is mainly a self evaluation, but please also address any issues with the course that impact your learning.*

To center in your mind what we are trying to do, review the course learning goals in the [syllabus](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/syllabus.html){:target="_blank"}, the [guidelines for log books](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/guides/p328_log_guide.html){:target="_blank"}, the [guidelines for reports](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/guides/p328_report_guide.html){:target="_blank"}, the [guidelines for papers](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/guides/p328_paper_guide.html){:target="_blank"}, and my feedback on your work. Then, reflect on your experience in the course so far.

Respond to the following prompts in the text entry box below. 

1. What have been your strengths and challenges in the course?
2. How did you address any challenges you faced?
3. What have you learned in this course that you will carry forward with you?
4. What would you like to add that isn't addressed above?
5. What final grade would you recommend that I submit to the Registrar? Give reasoning based on (a) the degree to which you met the standards spelled out in the guidelines for log books, reports, and the paper and (b) your growth with respect to the course-specific learning goals and skills in the syllabus.
