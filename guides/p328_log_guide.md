PHYS328W: Guidelines for Log Books
==================================

Your audience is your future self (and in this course, also me, since I
am evaluating your log book). Your notes are clear and detailed enough
that when you read them in a few weeks, as you're writing a paper on
your work, you (and I) will be able to figure out what you did.

Experimental Work
-----------------

1.  Use the available equipment effectively.

2.  Collect enough data of good enough quality to extract credible
    results.

3.  If things go wrong, make a reasonable effort to correct the
    problems.

Log Book Content
----------------

### Experiment

1.  Entries include date and time and who was present.

2.  Describe the configuration of the apparatus is described in enough
    detail that a reader could reproduce comparable raw data.

3.  Record any dimensions, settings, and other configuration parameters
    that might be needed to make sense of the raw data.

4.  Include clearly-labeled circuit diagrams.

5.  Record raw data in the log book if at all practical.

6.  Include the units of all physical quantities.

### Analysis

1.  Perform your entire analysis in the log book.

2.  Describe your methods of analysis in enough detail that a reader
    could perform the same analysis of your raw data and obtain the same
    results.

3.  Include images of derivations of important equations.
