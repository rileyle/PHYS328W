PHYS328W: Guidelines for Papers
===============================

Writing
-------

1.  Describe your work in enough detail that others can attempt to
    reproduce your results with similar equipment. Describe what you
    did. Avoid writing in the style of an instruction manual. Avoid
    lists of equipment.

2.  Use clear, precise, objective language. Replace or supplement
    ambiguous language like "acceptable" or "pretty good," with language
    that describes what you mean.

3.  Effectively integrate equations and references to figures and tables
    into your writing. They are part of the story.

4.  Organize your sentences and paragraphs in a coherent, logical
    sequence.

5.  Engage fully in the process of writing and revising drafts.

Analysis and Reasoning
----------------------

1.  Report a *complete* analysis of your data. If more information can
    be extracted from your data, extract it.

2.  Address uncertainties as indicated in the lab assignment.

    *We do not emphasize uncertainties very much in the electronics
    context, where agreement between measurement, theory, and simulation
    is generally quite good, and much of the time, devices are designed
    to allow for operating parameters to vary within acceptable ranges.
    This is not an invitation to develop the habit of ignoring
    uncertainties in general!*

3.  Commentary

    1.  Comment on the agreement of your results with theory/established
        results.

    2.  Describe how one might *productively* improve on your work.

    3.  Only make claims supported and accompanied by compelling
        evidence.

Mechanics
---------

1.  Figures and Tables

    1.  Label the axes of all of your graphs. Include units.

    2.  Include captions with all figures and tables, and refer to each
        figure and table at least once in the text of your paper. Use
        the LaTeX `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands to manage figure and
        table references.

2.  References

    1.  Bibliography format: Table I of
        <http://forms.aps.org/author/styleguide.pdf>.

    2.  Use the LaTeX `thebibliography` environment and `\cite{}`
        commands to produce numbered citations. List references in the
        order of first citation in your paper.

3.  Include units and uncertainties with all measurements and results
    derived from them.

4.  Find and fix grammar, punctuation, spelling, and typesetting errors.
