PHYS328W: Guidelines for Brief Reports
======================================

1.  **Experimental Work**

    1.  Use the available equipment effectively.

    2.  Collect enough data of good enough quality to extract credible
        results.

    3.  If things go wrong, make a reasonable effort to correct the
        problems.

2.  **Writing**

    1.  Use clear, precise, objective language. Replace or supplement
        ambiguous language like "acceptable" or "pretty good," with
        language that describes what you mean.

    2.  Effectively integrate equations and references to figures and
        tables into your writing. They are part of the story.

    3.  Organize your sentences and paragraphs in a coherent, logical
        sequence.

3.  **Analysis and Reasoning**

    1.  Report on your analysis to the extent indicated in the Products
        section of the lab assignment. *In many cases, this may simply
        be an scan or image of calculations done in your log book.*

    2.  Address uncertainties as indicated in the lab assignment.

        *We do not emphasize uncertainties very much in the electronics
        context, where agreement between measurement, theory, and
        simulation is generally quite good, and much of the time,
        devices are designed to allow for operating parameters to vary
        within acceptable ranges. This is not an invitation to develop
        the habit of ignoring uncertainties in general!*

    3.  Commentary

        1.  Comment on the agreement of your results with
            theory/established results.

        2.  Only make claims supported and accompanied by compelling
            evidence.

4.  **Mechanics**

    1.  Figures and Tables

        1.  Label the axes of all of your graphs. Include units.

        2.  Include captions with all figures and tables, and refer to
            each figure and table at least once in the text of your
            paper. Use the LaTeX `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands to
            manage figure and table references.

    2.  References

        1.  Bibliography format: Table I of
            <http://forms.aps.org/author/styleguide.pdf>.

        2.  Use the LaTeX `thebibliography` environment and `\cite{}`
            commands to produce numbered citations. List references in
            the order of first citation in your paper.

    3.  Include units and uncertainties with all measurements and
        results derived from them.

    4.  Find and fix grammar, punctuation, spelling, and typesetting
        errors.
