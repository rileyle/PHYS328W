Lab 1

  Go over the syllabus, and make sure you have at least one Windows
  laptop per group for OrCAD Capture (or you'll need to work out a
  solution with tech support).

  Measurements

    They very likely won't be comfortable with the breadboard or the
    DMM. Spell things out for the whole group. Explain with a sketch
    on the board how to plug the pot into the breadboard and connect
    the center pin with R1 and R2.

    There's no danger here, except that they could blow the fuse in or
    damage their prototyping board if they connect the 5 V supply
    directly to ground with a jumper wire. So don't do
    that. Connecting them with a resistor is fine, because the
    resistor keeps the current under control.

    Explain that they don't need to worry about blowing a fuse when
    making V and R measurements with the DMM, because the output
    resistance of the DMM is huge for these measurements. (With
    current measurements, you have to be careful.)

Calculations

    Give a mini lecture on the equivalent resistance -> supply current
    -> current division method of resistor network analysis.

Lab 2

Calculations

    They may not remember the Kirchhoff's rules lab at all. Go over
    the rules briefly at the start of lab.

Simulations

    If they don't reach the simulations by 2:45, shift gears and get
    them working on that so that they can get up and running with
    OrCAD Capture.
