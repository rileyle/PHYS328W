# LTspice Installation
- Download the installer for your platform (Windows or macOS) [here](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).
- Run the installer. (The defaults are fine.)
- You're all set! The tutorial videos on the Analog Devices web site are all too advanced to be helpful at this stage. The lab assignments will include detailed instructions, and you'll have support during lab meetings to help you climb the learning curve.
