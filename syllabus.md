## Instructor

[Dr. Lew Riley](https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/189-lew-riley){:target="_blank"} (he/him), [lriley@ursinus.edu](mailto:lriley@ursinus.edu), Pfahler Hall 112D, [schedule](https://rileyle.github.io/schedule.html){:target="_blank"}

## Course Description

PHYS328W: *Analog electronics* covers the foundations of analog circuits, including DC and AC circuits, transistors, and operational amplifiers with emphasis on laboratory techniques and the written communication of scientific results. Prerequisite: PHYS-122.

This is a 2 semester hour course. An average of three hours of laboratory per week.

## Learning Goals

### Department-Level Goals

- Use appropriate measuring instruments to determine the properties of a system under observation or experimentation. Use statistical methods to evaluate experimental or observational data. Write a clear paper in journal-article format reporting the methods, observations, analysis, and results. 

- Recognize the essential features of a physical system and design a mathematical or numerical model that includes them. Calculate numerical values for the properties of the system. 

### Course-Specific Goals

- Investigate experimentally how analog electronics components work and how they work together in systems. 
  
- Learn and practice circuit analysis techniques; use them to predict the behavior of the circuits you study, and compare these predictions with your measurements. 
  
- Understand, build, and test a relatively complex system (an AM radio receiver). 
  
- Practice keeping a digital log book for both measurements and data analysis that is useful to you and your collaborators. 
  
- Write brief reports and a formal paper that effectively communicate your work to an audience of undergraduate physics majors. 

### Skill Development

- Learn how to use a digital multimeters (DMM), a digital oscilloscope, a function generator, and a prototyping board/breadboard.

- Practice using JupyterLab and Python.

- Practice using L<SUP>A</SUP>T<SUB>E</SUB>X.

## Text

[These notes](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/notes/p328_notes/p328_notes.html){:target="_blank"} will serve as our text. You may also find this [quick reference guide](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/ref/p328_ref.pdf){:target="_ blank"} useful.

## Course Design

Canvas is the central organizational hub for this course. All assignments will be posted, collected, and evaluated in Canvas. The Modules page in Canvas shows an overview of the course, organized by lab assignment. This is the main landing page for the course site. The Canvas course stream at the bottom of the Syllabus and the Canvas Calendar are two additional ways of keeping track of assignments due.

The course is divided into six lab assignments. A module in Canvas is dedicated to each lab assignment including a link to a Jupyter notebook which describes the assignment in detail and serves as a template for your log book for the lab. The products of each lab assignment are usually due the night before we start the next lab assignment. 

When you have questions outside of lab meetings, post them to the chat of the Teams site for this course.

### Log Books (Jupyter Notebooks)

You will use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org){:target="_blank"} for electronic log books in which you will record measurements and do your data analysis. It is provided by the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com){:target="_blank"} distribution, available for free for Windows, macOS, and Linux. (Installation and configuration instructions are included in a very early assignment.) Bring your laptop with you whenever you come to lab.

### Brief Reports and the Final Paper

One of the primary goals of this course is to help you develop your scientific writing skills. The final product of each of the first five lab assignment will be a brief report. You will write one paper in journal-article format for the final lab assignment (the AM radio receiver). 

*Although you may collaborate on experimental work, you will write your own reports and papers.*

You will write your reports and papers using L<SUP>A</SUP>T<SUB>E</SUB>X, a typesetting program commonly used by physicists, astronomers, mathematicians, computer scientists. You may use your preferred L<SUP>A</SUP>T<SUB>E</SUB>X environment. If you don't have one set up, I recommend the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com){:target="_blank"} online L<SUP>A</SUP>T<SUB>E</SUB>X development environment.

## Assessment

There is a growing body of evidence that grades do not facilitate learning --- and can actually shut it down (see [Blum, Susan D., and Alfie Kohn. Ungrading, WVU Press, 2020](https://ursinuscollege.on.worldcat.org/search?sortKey=LIBRARY&databaseList=&queryString=au%3Ablum+ti%3AUngrading){:target="_blank"}). 

While I will submit a final grade for this course to the Registrar at the end of the semester, *I will not grade individual assignments.* Instead, I will give you feedback in Canvas on your log books, brief reports, and a draft(s) of your final paper, and I will assign a status:

- Missing/Unable to Assess
- Needs Revision (resubmission strongly recommended)
- Complete (resubmissions accepted)

I will collect periodic self evaluations from you addressing your learning and how the course is going throughout the semester. These will carry a "Complete/Incomplete" status in Canvas. I will give you feedback on these reflections, so that we will be in regular conversation about how you are doing in the course. 

*Note: The Canvas grade book will report a raw numerical score based on the status codes for logs, reports, the paper, and reflections. This might serve as a very rough indicator of progress, but it is not your grade. I am happy to meet with you at any point to discuss how you are doing.*

Near the end of the semester, you will write a final self evaluation of your work in which you will propose a final grade.  I will then determine your final grade based on your work for the course, my feedback on your work, and your self evaluations and my feedback on those, with possible stipulations based on work not yet handed in.

## On Due Dates

While I expect you to do your best to hand in work on time, due dates are flexible, especially since I may sometimes ask you to revise your work. There is a firm deadline by which I must submit final grades for the course which will limit my ability to manage late work near the end of the semester.

## Collaboration, Acknowledgment, and Academic Honesty

I encourage you to collaborate with each other on lab work. Not only can you get help when you need it, but you can help other people as well. Teaching is a very effective way to learn. While I encourage collaboration, it is also important that you understand your work and articulate your reasoning clearly. All of the writing in your reports and final paper must be your own. 

Use of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, e.g.) to assist you with your writing for this course is off-limits for at least two reasons. First, developing your scientific writing skills is a goal of this course, and relying on someone or something else to do part or all of that work undermines your development as a writer and thinker. Second, the large language models on which generative AI writing tools are built are trained on the writing  of other people, and they offer no way to cite the sources of the writing they produce (see the next paragraph).

Handing in someone else's writing or other work as your own is plagiarism, while receiving help which you acknowledge is not. Please clear up any questions you have about what constitutes plagiarism right away. Collaboration of any kind or copying someone else's work during an exam is cheating. If I believe that you have cheated, plagiarized, or committed any academic honesty violation, I will discuss the incident with you and consult with the Dean of the College regarding the consequences. (See the [Student Handbook](https://www.ursinus.edu/student-life/handbook/){:target="_blank"} for a detailed description of College policies related to [Academic Honesty](https://www.ursinus.edu/student-life/handbook/section-ii-additional-expectations-resources/academic-honesty/){:target="_blank"}.) 

## Attendance

The success of this laboratory course depends on your presence in the lab. If you have exceptional circumstances that will affect your attendance, please discuss them with me. Three or more unexcused absences may result in a grade of 'F' in the course.

## Disability Statement

Ursinus College is committed to ensuring equal access and providing reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. The Institute for Student Success works with students who have any kind of disability, whether apparent or non-apparent, learning, emotional, physical, or cognitive, and need accommodations to increase their access to this learning environment. I encourage you to reach out to Dee Singley or Joanna Timmerman, the disability and access team, to discuss supports and accommodations you may need. The disability and access office is located in Lower Myrin, with the UCARE office. Email them at [disabilityandaccess@ursinus.edu](mailto:disabilityandaccess@ursinus.edu). Check out their resources and services: [Disability and Access at Ursinus Webpage](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/disability-and-access/){:target="_blank"}

## Statement of Inclusivity

In this class we will work to promote an environment where everyone feels safe and welcome. As we explore ideas, every voice in the room has something of value to contribute to group discussion. Because the group will represent a diversity of individual beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences, every participant must show respect for all others. You are encouraged to not only take advantage of opportunities to express your own ideas, but also to learn from the information and ideas shared by other students. Participation is crucial to the success of this classroom experience. Your insights, questions and comments will be useful not only to yourself and to your adviser, but to your fellow students.

The college recognizes that temporary financial hardships can impact students' access to course materials, as well as their access to opportunities on campus. The [Bear2Bear fund](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/student-financial-services/grants-scholarships-loans/bear2bear-student-emergency-fund/){:target="_blank"} has been established by donors to the college and provides special grants for students who have exhausted other sources of funding. 

The Wellness Center has a virtual drop-in crisis hour at 2-3 pm each weekday, which is available for students in crisis who need to be seen immediately by a clinician. Their resources are confidential and free to all students. Please consult the [Wellness Center web site](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/wellness-center/){:target="_blank"} for more information and the link to the virtual crisis hour. 

## Course Evaluation (SPTQ)

At the end of the semester, I will ask you to give me feedback on the course and my teaching by completing a course evaluation. The Student Perception of Teaching Questionnaire (SPTQ) is administered online, and your responses are anonymous. The SPTQ serves two important purposes. First, student feedback has a significant, direct impact on my teaching and how I run this course. Second, the College considers SPTQ responses in evaluating the performance of faculty members. 

## Email

Checking your Ursinus email regularly is required for this course. I sometimes use email to convey important course information, and I will assume that you are able to receive it. If this presents problems for you, please let me know. 

## Inclement Weather

If I am unable to hold class due to inclement weather, I will send out an email notification as early as possible.
