## Course Description

PHYS328W: *Analog electronics* covers the foundations of analog
circuits, including DC and AC circuits, transistors, and operational
amplifiers with emphasis on laboratory techniques and the written
communication of scientific results. Prerequisite: PHYS-122.

This is a 2 semester hour course. One hour of lecture; an average of
three hours of laboratory per week. Two semester hours.

## Learning Goals

### Department-Level Goals

- Use appropriate measuring instruments to determine the properties of
  a system under observation or experimentation. Use statistical
  methods to evaluate experimental or observational data. Write a
  clear paper in journal-article format reporting the methods,
  observations, analysis, and results. 

- Recognize the essential features of a physical system and design a
  mathematical or numerical model that includes them. Calculate
  numerical values for the properties of the system. 

### Course-Specific Goals

- Investigate experimentally how analog electronics components work
  and how they work together in systems. 
  
- Learn and practice circuit analysis techniques; use them to predict
  the behavior of the circuits you study, and compare these 
  predictions with your measurements. 
  
- Understand, build, and test a relatively complex system (a working
  AM radio receiver). 
  
- Practice keeping a digital log book for both measurements and data
  analysis that is useful to you and your collaborators. 
  
- Write brief reports and a formal paper that effectively communicate
  your work to an audience of undergraduate physics majors. 

### Skill Development

- Learn how to use a digital multimeters (DMM), a digital
  oscilloscope, a function generator, and a prototyping
  board/breadboard.
  
- Practice using L<SUP>A</SUP>T<SUB>E</SUB>X.

- Practice using JupyterLab and Python.

useful.

## Course Design

Canvas is the central organizational hub for this course. All
assignments will be posted, collected, and graded in Canvas. The
Modules page in Canvas shows an overview of the course, organized by
experiment. This is the main landing page for the course site. The
Canvas course stream at the bottom of the Syllabus and the Canvas
Calendar are two additional ways of keeping track of assignments due.

The course is divided into six lab assignments. A module in Canvas is
dedicated to each lab assignment including a link to a Jupyter
notebook which describes the assignment in detail and serves as a
template for your log book for the lab. The products of each lab
assignment should be uploaded to the corresponding Canvas assignment,
usually due the night before we start the next lab assignment. 

### Log Books (Jupyter Notebooks)

You will use 
[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org){:target="_blank"}
for electronic log books in which you will record measurements and
do your data analysis. It is provided by the 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com){:target="_blank"}
distribution, available for free for Windows, macOS, and
Linux. (Installation and configuration instructions are included in a
very early assignment.) Bring your laptop with you whenever you come
to lab.

### Brief Reports and the Final Paper

One of the primary goals of this course is to help you develop your
scientific writing skills. The final product of each of the first five
lab assignment will be a brief report. You will write one paper in
journal-article format for the final lab assignment (the AM radio
receiver). 

*Although you may collaborate on experimental work and
simulations, you will write your own reports and papers.*

You will write your reports and papers using
L<SUP>A</SUP>T<SUB>E</SUB>X, a typesetting program commonly used by
physicists, astronomers, mathematicians, computer scientists. You may
use your preferred L<SUP>A</SUP>T<SUB>E</SUB>X environment. If you
don't have one set up, I recommend the
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com){:target="_blank"}
online L<SUP>A</SUP>T<SUB>E</SUB>X development environment.

## Assessment

There is a growing body of evidence that grades do not facilitate
--- and can actually shut down --- learning (see [Blum, Susan D., and
Alfie Kohn. Ungrading, WVU Press, 2020](https://ursinuscollege.on.worldcat.org/search?sortKey=LIBRARY&databaseList=&queryString=au%3Ablum+ti%3AUngrading){:target="_blank"}). 

While I will submit a final grade for this course to the Registrar
at the end of the semester, *I will not grade individual assignments.*
Instead, I will give you feedback in Canvas on your log books, 
brief reports, and a draft(s) of your final paper, and I will assign a
numerical status code:

- **0**: Missing/Unable to Assess
- **1**: Needs Revision (resubmission strongly recommended)
- **2**: Meets guidelines (resubmissions accepted)
- **3**: Exceeds guidelines

I will also collect periodic written reflections from you in Canvas on
your learning and on how the course is going throughout the
semester. These will carry a "Complete/Incomplete" status (1/0)
in Canvas. I will give you feedback on these reflections. If you are
ever unclear as to how you are doing in the course, *let's talk*.

*Note: The Canvas gradebook will report a raw numerical score based on the
status codes for logs, reports, the paper, and reflections. This might serve
as a very rough indicator of progress, but it is not your grade.*

Near the end of the semester, I will ask you to submit a final written
reflection on your work in which you will propose a final grade. That
will serve as a starting point for an individual meeting to 
review my feedback and your reflections. I will determine your final
grade in our meeting, with possible stipulations based on work not yet
handed in.

## Collaboration, Acknowledgment, and Academic Honesty

I encourage you to collaborate with each other on lab work. Not only
can you get help when you need it, but you can help other people as
well. Teaching is a very effective way to learn. While I encourage
collaboration, it is also important that you understand your work and
articulate your reasoning clearly. All of the writing in your reports
and final paper must be your own. 

Handing in someone else's writing or other work as your own is
plagiarism, while receiving help which you acknowledge is not. Please
clear up any questions you have about what constitutes plagiarism
right away. Collaboration of any kind or copying someone else's work
during an exam is cheating. If I believe that you have cheated,
plagiarized, or committed any academic honesty violation, I will
discuss the incident with you and consult with the Dean of the College
regarding the consequences. (See the 
[Student Handbook](https://www.ursinus.edu/student-life/handbook/){:target="_blank"} 
for a detailed description of College policies related to 
[Academic Honesty](https://www.ursinus.edu/student-life/handbook/section-ii-additional-expectations-resources/academic-honesty/){:target="_blank"}.) 

## Attendance

In keeping with a strong liberal arts tradition that encourages active
learning and complete participation in the education process, the
college expects students to attend class. Attendance in a laboratory
course involving significant group work is crucial. 

The Office of Academic Affairs, the Office of Student Affairs, and the
Wellness Center do not provide excused absences from class for any
reason (illness, family, personal, etc.). In the event that a student
experiences a significant health problem or other issue that may
prevent them from performing adequately in their academic work and/or
attending class for a number of days, students should notify the
Office of Student Affairs. The Student Affairs phone and email contact
is Lynda Manz: [lmanz@ursinus.edu](mailto:lmanz@ursinus.edu) or 
610-409-3590. In emergencies where faculty notification is not
feasible, the Office of Student Affairs staff can assist students with
faculty notifications. Upon students' return to class, it is their
responsibility to talk to professors and to develop a plan for making
up missed work.

## Disability Statement

Ursinus College is committed to ensuring equal access and providing
reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. The
Institute for Student Success works with students who have any kind of
disability, whether apparent or non-apparent, learning, emotional,
physical, or cognitive, and need accommodations to increase their
access to this learning environment. I encourage you to reach out to
the Director of Disability Services, Dr. Dolly Singley to discuss
supports and accommodations you may need. Dolly’s office is located in
the Institute for Student Success in Lower Wismer. You can schedule a
meeting with Dolly by using this link: 
[https://dsingley.youcanbook.me](https://dsingley.youcanbook.me){:target="_blank"}, by
emailing her at [dsingley@ursinus.edu](mailto:dsingley@ursinus.edu)
or by calling her at 1-484-762-4329. Students can also review
accessibility and disabilities services online at
[https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/institute-for-student-success/students-with-disabilities/](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/institute-for-student-success/students-with-disabilities/){:target="_blank"}

## Statement of Inclusivity

In this class we will work to promote an environment where everyone
feels safe and welcome. As we explore ideas, every voice in the room
has something of value to contribute to group discussion. Because the
group will represent a diversity of individual beliefs, backgrounds,
and experiences, every participant must show respect for all
others. You are encouraged to not only take advantage of opportunities
to express your own ideas, but also to learn from the information and
ideas shared by other students. Participation is crucial to the
success of this classroom experience. Your insights, questions and
comments will be useful not only to yourself and to your adviser, but
to your fellow students. 

In order to allow for equitable access to class for students who may
be attending and participating remotely, I will record our class
sessions. These recordings will only be available to students enrolled
in this course. The Teams app will explicitly indicate when we are
recording. Out of respect and privacy for me and all class members,
please do not download, copy, or redistribute class recordings.

The college recognizes that temporary financial hardships can impact
students' access to course materials, as well as their access to
opportunities on campus. The 
[Bear2Bear fund](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/student-financial-services/grants-scholarships-loans/bear2bear-student-emergency-fund/){:target="_blank"}
has been established by donors to the college and provides special
grants for students who have exhausted other sources of funding. 

The Wellness Center has a virtual drop-in crisis hour at 2-3 pm each
weekday, which is available for students in crisis who need to be seen
immediately by a clinician. Their resources are confidential and free
to all students. Please consult the 
[Wellness Center web site](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/wellness-center/){:target="_blank"}
for more information and the link to the virtual
crisis hour. 

## Course Evaluation (SPTQ)

At the end of the semester, I will ask you to give me feedback on the
course and my teaching by completing a course evaluation. The Student
Perception of Teaching Questionnaire (SPTQ) is administered online,
and your responses are anonymous. The SPTQ serves two important
purposes. First, student feedback has a significant, direct impact on
my teaching and how I run this course. Second, the College considers
SPTQ responses in evaluating the performance of faculty members. 

## Email

Checking your Ursinus email regularly is required for this course. I
sometimes use email to convey important course information, and I will
assume that you are able to receive it. If this presents problems for
you, please let me know. 

## Inclement Weather

If I am unable to hold class due to inclement weather, I will send out
an email notification as early as possible.
