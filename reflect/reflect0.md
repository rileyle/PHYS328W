Periodic evaluations keep us focused on the goals of the course, help us identify and address challenges and other issues so that this can be a successful learning experience, and serve as an ongoing conversation that will eventually result in your final grade. *This is mainly a self evaluation, but please also address any issues with the course that impact your learning.*

To center in your mind what we are trying to do, review the course learning goals in the [Syllabus](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/syllabus.html){:target="_blank"}, the [guidelines for log books](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/guides/p328_log_guide.html){:target="_blank"}, the [guidelines for reports](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/guides/p328_report_guide.html){:target="_blank"}, and the [guidelines for papers](https://rileyle.github.io/PHYS328W/guides/p328_paper_guide.html){:target="_blank"}. 

Respond to the following prompts in the text entry box below. 

1. What are your goals for this course?
2. What are your strengths and challenges that will impact this course?
3. What do you plan to do to address any challenges you have identified?
4. What support do you need from me or your colleagues?
5. What would you like to add that isn't addressed above?
